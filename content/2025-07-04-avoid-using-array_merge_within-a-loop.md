If you're a PHP developer, chances are you've encountered (or written) code like this:

```php source
$userLists = [];
foreach ($this->someCall() as $someObject) {
    $userLists = array_merge($userLists, $someObject->getUsers());
}
```

The goal here is to populate the `$userLists` array with users returned from some external source (in this case, from
`$someObject->getUsers()`). An instinct is to use `array_merge` inside the loop to combine arrays.

While this works, there's a performance caveat: `array_merge` creates a new array every time it's called, duplicating
all elements and discarding the previous one. This approach may be fine for small arrays, but the cost grows
significantly with larger datasets.

## Alternatives for better performance

### Spread operator (merge once at the end)

Instead of merging in every iteration, we collect all elements and merge them only once at the end.

```php source
$userLists = [];
foreach ($this->someCall() as $someObject) {
    $userLists[] = $someObject->getUsers();
}
$userLists = array_merge(...$userLists);
```

Pros and cons:

- ğŸŸ  Requires PHP 7.4+ (spread operator for arrays)
- ğŸ”´ If any `$someObject->getUsers()` returns an empty array, PHP emits a warning (you'll need to check or provide a
  default value)
- ğŸ”´ Holds all intermediate arrays in memory before merging
- ğŸŸ¢ Clean and modern syntax
- ğŸŸ¢ Performs only one merge operation â€” faster than repeated array_merge() in a loop

### Manual nested loop

This method avoids all intermediate arrays and merges on the fly.

```php source
$userLists = [];
foreach ($this->someCall() as $someObject) {
    foreach ($someObject->getUsers() as $user) {
        $userLists[] = $user;
    }
}
```

Pros and cons:

- ğŸŸ¢ Works on all PHP versions
- ğŸŸ¢ No risk of warning if `$someObject->getUsers()` returns an empty array (the inner loop is not executed)
- ğŸŸ¢ Best memory performance for large datasets
- ğŸ”´ Slightly more verbose
